## A web application to analyze Oktoberfest data
It's March 2018. Tomorrow is [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/). 
Back in September 2017, I tried building a [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to analyze [Oktoberfest](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oktoberfest) data that are freely availale on the [Munich Open Data Portal](https://www.opengov-muenchen.de/dataset/oktoberfest). My main motivation was to present the Shiny app at the September event of [R-Ladies Munich](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-munich/). Unfortunately, my knowledge of `shiny` was still pretty limited.

### At the R-Ladies Munich event
I therefore decided to present some analysis of the Oktoberfest data, based on a [blog post](https://gresch.github.io/2017/09/14/201701oktoberfest1985-2016/) by @[gresch](https://twitter.com/gre__sch). I couldn't present the shiny app, but I did talk about `shiny` and how to build a simple web application (something that I could do and show).
