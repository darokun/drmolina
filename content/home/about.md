# Hi, I'm Daloha!

I am currently a **PhD candidate of Epidemiology** at the [LMU Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and working at the [Outpatient Clinic for Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine](http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Institut-und-Poliklinik-fuer-Arbeits-Sozial-und-Umweltmedizin/en/index.html) of the Ludwig Maximilian University Munich under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Katja Radon](http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Institut-und-Poliklinik-fuer-Arbeits-Sozial-und-Umweltmedizin/de/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/Prof__Radon/ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/radon/index.html). My PhD project is about **antibiotic resistance in employees and local residents of wastewater treatment plants (AWARE-WWTP)**.

For my master thesis, I applied [Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://biostats.bepress.com/ucbbiostat/paper252/) to try to find the **causal effect of an educational intervention to evaluate how much do Bavarian farming apprentices know about preventive measures against asthma and allergies**. You may read a pre-print of that paper **[here](https://zenodo.org/record/376116)**. I am also an **online tutor** of two courses at the [International Master of Occupational Safety and Health (LMU)](http://www.en.m-osh.med.uni-muenchen.de/index.html): Ergonomics and Scientific English. 

The rest of my time I spend it organizing [R-Ladies Munich](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-munich/) events, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/darokun), [making](https://tulipsanddragons.bandcamp.com/) or [listening](https://www.last.fm/user/darokun) to music, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16917378-daloha-rodr-guez-molina), traveling, or making [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdpHrWv_rUqAxf1QmEpQuEA). I've been recently selected to be part of the [NASA Datanauts Spring Class 2018](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/).

I created this webpage using [George Cushen's hugo-academic template](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) and [Alison Presmanes Hill's tutorial](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/).
